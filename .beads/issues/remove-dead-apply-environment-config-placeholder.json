  "description": "DEAD CODE: orchestrator._apply_environment_config() (line 180-184) is a placeholder that does nothing (pass), but environment merging already happens in parse_service_file() via EnvironmentMerger. The orchestrator calls this method but it has no effect. Should either remove the method or document that it's intentionally a no-op hook.",
