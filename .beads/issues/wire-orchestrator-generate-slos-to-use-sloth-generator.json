  "description": "PLACEHOLDER DETECTED: orchestrator._generate_slos() (line 422-434) dumps raw SLO resources to YAML with TODO comment, but complete Sloth generator exists at generators/sloth.py with generate_sloth_spec() that converts NthLayer SLOs to proper Sloth format with alerting configs. Pattern: Same as recording rules issue - implementation exists but isn't wired.",
