Add comprehensive reproducibility test suite\n\n**Test Strategy:**\n- test_generation_idempotent(): Same YAML generates identical files twice\n- test_no_ordering_artifacts(): Reordered resources produce identical output\n- test_plan_apply_counts_match(): Plan and apply report same counts","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-03T21:00:00Z","updated_at":"2026-01-03T21:00:00Z"}
