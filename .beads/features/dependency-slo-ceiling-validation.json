  "title": "Dependency SLO ceiling validation",
  "description": "Add validation to nthlayer validate-spec that warns when SLO target exceeds max achievable based on dependencies. Uses DEPENDENCY_SLAS knowledge base (postgresql=99.95%, redis=99.99%, kafka=99.95%, stripe=99.9%, etc.). Calculates max by multiplying dependency SLAs. Warns: 'Target 99.95% but max achievable is 99.84% based on dependencies'. Inspired by Google SRE 'Rule of the Extra 9'.",
