  "description": "**Approach: Pre-Generated Service Gallery (Zero-Cost)**\n\nBuild GitHub Pages demo showcasing NthLayer's capabilities through curated examples.\n\n**Service Gallery (5-8 pre-generated):**\n- payment-api (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes)\n- checkout-service (MySQL, RabbitMQ, ECS)\n- notification-worker (Redis, Kafka, Kubernetes)\n- analytics-stream (MongoDB, Kafka, Kubernetes)\n- user-service (PostgreSQL, Redis, ECS)\n- recommendation-engine (Redis, Kafka, Kubernetes)\n\n**Each service includes:**\n- Live Grafana dashboard (embedded, public URL)\n- Mock metrics flowing (shows real data)\n- Service YAML displayed (read-only, for reference)\n- Auto-generated: 3 SLOs, 12-40 alerts, recording rules\n- Technology-specific panels (PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, etc)\n\n**User Experience:**\n1. Land on demo page\n2. Browse service gallery (cards with icons)\n3. Click service \u2192 view live dashboard + service YAML\n4. 'Random Service' button for instant demo\n5. Clear CTA: 'Install NthLayer to generate this for your services'\n\n**NO Downloads:**\n- Users cannot download JSON/configs\n- Demo shows capabilities only\n- Must install NthLayer to generate artifacts\n\n**Value Prop:** \n'See NthLayer's technology intelligence in action - detecting dependencies and auto-generating production-ready observability'\n\n**Technical:**\n- Extend current Fly.io app with 4-7 additional mock services\n- Each service has unique mock metrics\n- All dashboards pre-pushed to Grafana Cloud (public)\n- GitHub Pages with clean gallery UI\n\n**Zero-Cost:**\n- Fly.io free tier sufficient (256MB RAM per service)\n- 8 dashboards well within Grafana Cloud free tier\n- GitHub Pages free\n\n**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours",
