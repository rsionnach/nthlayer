  "description": "Intelligent SLO target recommendations. Three approaches: 1) Tier-based defaults (critical=99.95%, standard=99.9%, best-effort=99%), 2) Dependency-aware max calculation (multiply dependency SLAs to find ceiling), 3) Latency budget based on dependency overhead (base + PostgreSQL 50ms + Redis 5ms + external API 200ms). recommend_slo() tool returns target, reasoning, max_achievable, and burn rate alert thresholds. NthLayer brings SRE expertise to the conversation - recommends targets instead of asking user to specify them.",
