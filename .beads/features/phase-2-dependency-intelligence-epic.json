Implemented: Prometheus-based dependency discovery, identity resolution (service name normalization, aliases, fuzzy matching), dependency graph model, nthlayer deps CLI command, nthlayer blast-radius CLI command. Uses existing Prometheus metrics (http_client_requests_total, grpc_client_handled_total, etc.) to discover service dependencies. Future phases add Kubernetes, Backstage, and ownership providers.",
