  "title": "Embed Grafana dashboard URLs in generated alert annotations",
  "description": "Since NthLayer generates both alerts AND dashboards, link them together. Add dashboard_url and traces_url annotations to all generated Prometheus alerts. Example: dashboard: 'https://grafana.internal/d/{{ service.name }}'. Low effort since we already know the dashboard UID we generate. Inspired by fatihkoc.net SRE observability article.",
