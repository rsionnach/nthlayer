  "title": "Wire orchestrator to use existing recording rules implementation",
  "description": "The orchestrator._generate_recording_rules() method writes a placeholder file and returns hardcoded estimate (slo_count * 7), but a complete implementation already exists in src/nthlayer/recording_rules/. The builder.py has RecordingRuleBuilder that generates availability, latency, and error rate SLO rules plus health metrics. The CLI command generate_recording_rules_command() in cli/recording_rules.py works correctly. Fix: Update orchestrator to call generate_recording_rules_command() similar to how _generate_alerts() calls generate_alerts_for_service().",
